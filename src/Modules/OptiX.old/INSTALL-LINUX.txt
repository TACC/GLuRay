In order to compile the samples in the SDK you need the following:

1. CUDA Toolkit 2.3, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0, 4.2, 5.0 or 5.5

2. CMake 2.8.8 or later (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).

3. C++ compiler (gcc 4.4 and 4.6 have been tested)

To compile:

Instructions for building.
1. Create a build directory other than the SDK/ directory.  Using a separate
   build directory allows multiple builds, differing in flavor, platform, etc.
2. cd to new directory.
3. Run
     $ ccmake <path>
   where path is the path to the SDK/ directory.  This will bring up
   the cmake interface.
4. Press 'c' within ccmake to begin configure process.
5. Adjust any options, such as build flavor, by moving cursor to field and
   hitting <enter>, changing value, and hitting <enter> again.  One field you
   may want to change is CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to select a Debug build (it defaults
   to Release which is an optimized build).  CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE will also
   control the bitness of the generated PTX code.  It defaults to 32 bits
   (OFF).
6. Press 'c' again to finish configure.
7. Press 'g' to generate Makefiles and exit.
8. Run
     $ make
   to build.
9. Executables should be found in the bin directory.
