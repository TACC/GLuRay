In order to compile the samples in the SDK you need the following.

1. Visual Studio 2008, 2010 or 2012.

2. CUDA Toolkit 2.3, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0 or 5.5.  CUDA 5.5 is
required for Visual Studio 2012.

3. CMake 2.8.8 minimum (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).
For Visual Studio 2012 2.8.10 or 2.8.12 is recommended.  The current version
as of this writing is 2.8.11.2.  I suggest the executable installer
(http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.11.2-win32-x86.exe).

Instructions for building.

1. Start up cmake-gui from the Start Menu.

2. Select the <path>/OptiX SDK 3.5.0/SDK directory from the installation for the
   source file location.

3. Create a build directory that isn't the same as the source directory.  I
   would suggest <path>/OptiX SDK 3.5.0/SDK/build.  If you don't have
   permissions to write into the this directory (writing into the "C:/Program
   Files" directory can be restricted in some cases), pick a different
   directory where you do have write permissions.  If you type in the directory
   (instead of using the "Browse Build..." button), CMake will ask you at the
   next step to create the directory for you if it doesn't already exist.

4. Press "Configure" button and select the version of Visual Studio you wish to
   use.  Note that the 64-bit compiles are separate from the 32-bit compiles
   (e.g. look for "Visual Studio 10 2010" or "Visual Studio 10 2010 Win64").
   Leave all other options on their default.  Press "OK".  If you wish to have
   both a 32- and 64-bit build you will need to configure multiple build
   directories, one for each build type.  This can take a while while source
   level dependencies for CUDA files are computed.

Note that if you wish to have 64-bit device code generation for a 64-bit build,
check the box next to CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE in the GUI.  The default value is
OFF which will generate 32-bit device code.

5. Press "Configure" again.  Followed by "Generate".

6. Open the OptiX-Samples.sln solution file in the build directory you created.

7. Select "Build Solution" from the IDE.

8. Right click on one of the sample program targets in the solution explorer and
   select "Set as start up project".

9. Run the sample.  "q" or "Esc" will close the window.

Note that due to the way dependencies are automatically handled for CUDA
compilation in Visual Studio, if you build again Visual Studio will likely ask
you to reload your projects.  Please do so.  Subsequent compiles should not
result in reloading unless you change the files that are included in a CUDA
file.

Further instructions regarding the build system can be found in comments in the
SDK's CMakeLists.txt file.
