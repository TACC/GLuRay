/*
 *prerequisites:
 */
1.  the latest build of Manta.  Enable DYNBV_APPROX and DYNBVH_LAZY_BUILD options in Manta for significantly faster acceleration structure build times.
2.  cmake [ccmake recommended]

/*
 *building:
 */

mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..

in CMAKE options you will need to set the location of MANTA_SRC and MANTA_BUILD_PREFIX.

config files are in the form: -apply [-spp <number of samples per pixel] [ -threads <int> ] [-skydome <int number>  <float size of dome> <float 0-1 intensity>] [-reflectivity <float 0-1>] [-env <string path to .hdr file>] [-ao <int number> <float cutoff distance> <float intensity>] [-phong] [-shadows] [-no_gl_lights] [-rotate <float speed> <float offset>] [-plane] [-thinLens <float focaldistance> <float aperture>] [-pinhole] [-lambertian] [-thinDielectric] [-metal] [-transparent] [-orenNayar] [-write_to_file <string file or may say generated to generate file names for each frame>]
